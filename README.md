publicautocomplete
==================

This civicrm extension allows an anonymous user to have an autocomplete field instead of a free form one, to avoid mispelled/duplicate organisation names due to the current employer

Install
======

Still need to figure out the zip install version, so far, git clone https://github.com/TechToThePeople/publicautocomplete.git in your local extension repository and it should work

you need to patch js/rest.js if you are not running from trunk

Configuration
=============

You need to add in your civicrm.settings.php (or settings.php)
